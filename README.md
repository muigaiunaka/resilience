# #CommitResilience


Regardless of your political affiliation, the week of 11.08.16 was a tough one for many in our community. Most of us fall into at least one of the categorizations of people vilified, objectified, and physically threatened by supporters of our President-elect. We’re black, Latino, Jewish, Muslim, gay, straight, and more besides. We’re a pretty eclectic community. And when one of us is hurt, we’re all hurt.

We’ve chosen to react by supporting each other in real, tangible ways. We’ve launched an initiative called Commit Resilience, inviting anyone to share a single action they’ll commit to making, in reaction to these events. We invite you to read the mission statement, and join us in making a single commitment to yourself and your community. Share it on social media, or -- even better -- share it in person.
